wso2registry-extensions
This repository hosts extensions supporting API management with wso2 governance registry.

There are three modules types:

A web application (WAR) deployed to the WSO2 carbon platform in order to support integration with other systems (based on Apache Camel).
A maven plugin to publish artifacts to the registry during the build process.
Handlers deployed to the service registry, in order to extend the core functionality.
